The code defines two functions: preprocess_text and screen_resume.

--2
preprocess_text preprocesses a text string by tokenizing it and removing stop words.

--3
screen_resume takes a resume PDF path and a job description string as inputs, preprocesses them, 
vectorizes the preprocessed text, and computes their cosine similarity score.

--4
The find_best_resume function takes a directory path and a job description string as inputs, 
loops through each resume PDF file in the directory, 
and calls screen_resume to find the resume with the highest cosine similarity score.

--5
The main part of the code specifies a job_description and a directory_path, calls find_best_resume, 
and prints the path to the best matching resume and its similarity score

Cosine similarity:
Identifying the similarity between pairs of a document is a good use case for the utilization of cosine similarity,
as a quantification of the measurement of similarity between two objects.
Quantification of the similarity between two documents can be obtained by converting the words or phrases,
into a vectorized form of representation.
The vector representations of the documents can then be used within the cosine similarity formula,
to obtain a quantification of similarity.
In the scenario described above, the cosine similarity of 1 implies that the two documents are exactly alike. 
A cosine similarity of 0 would conclude that there are no similarities between the two documents.

cos(Î¸)=(A.B)/||A||.||B||

The function then uses the TfidfVectorizer from the sklearn library to convert the preprocessed text into numerical vectors. 
The fit_transform method of the vectorizer is called on a list containing the preprocessed resume and job description, 
which creates a sparse matrix of numerical vectors representing the text.

A sparse matrix is a matrix that has a large number of zero entries. 
This is particularly useful when working with numerical vectors representing text data, 
where most entries will be zero since any given document will only contain a small fraction of the total vocabulary.
To represent text as numerical vectors, one common approach is to use the bag-of-words model. 
This model represents each document as a vector of word frequencies,
where the entries correspond to the frequency of each word in the vocabulary. 
However, since most documents only contain a small fraction of the vocabulary, the resulting matrix will be sparse.
To create a sparse matrix of numerical vectors representing text, you can use a library such as Scikit-learn in Python. 
The library provides tools for preprocessing text data and creating sparse matrices.
